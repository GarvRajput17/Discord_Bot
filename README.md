# **POKI BOT**

## Track -> Discord Bot

**Main Contributors:** @GarvRajput17, Hitanshu078, areen-patil

**Problem Statement:** Create a Discord bot on the theme: Arcade-Bot

**Goal:** The aim is to make a complete functioning bot on the theme of Pokemon that includes multiple games related to the Pokemon Universe.

## **WELCOME TO THE POKEMON UNIVERSE!**

Our Poki bot includes almost all the Pokémon related games and mini-games you can think of on a fundamental level.

- Imagine being a Trainer and owning Pokemons! This is possible in our Poki bot.
  - Build your multipurpose inventory that contains almost all Pokémon, berries, potions, pokeballs, and other utility items.
  - Buy Pokemons and the Utility items from the marketplace.
  - Sell Pokemons and the Utility items from the marketplace.
  - The more you interact, the more your experience level increases.

- The famous "Who's that Pokemon" game where you can test your knowledge about the Pokémon (includes all generations).
- Think you are the Master of the Pokemon's universe? You can play Trivia where The Bot can ask you literally anything related to the Pokemon universe.
- Challenge other Discord members as you can battle with them using the Pokémon in a 1v1 game.

- Card Collection game! Yes!
  - Not only You can collect Pokémon and utility items, we have a separate inventory for you where you can collect cards related to Pokémon. You probably would like to test your luck for the legendary card drops.
  - You can even trade the cards with other members in the Discord (Note: the complete syntax for the trade command is $trade @username <pokemon_name>).

- **(Bonus)** -> We have a story mode too where we have tried to create a story mode game inspired from Pokemon: Power of Us Movie.

## **Tech Stack used:**

The bot is created using basic Python Functions and using JSON files for storing the data of the user.

**Libraries used:**

`OS`, `Discord`, `Requests`, `aiohttp`, `random`, `time`, `json`, `asyncio`

**APIs have been used extensively for the Pokémon database:**

1. [Pokemon Trivia API](https://pokemontrivia-1-c0774976.deta.app/trivia?endpoint=images)
2. [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2)
3. [TCG Dex API](https://api.tcgdex.net/v2/en)

## **How to run the code:**

- Invite link of the Bot to your server: [Poki Bot Invite Link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1224714002894946455&permissions=0&scope=bot)
- You can start with `$hello` command to get all the commands.
- If you need to see all the commands you can type `$help`.
- For any more queries, you can contact @GarvRajput17 [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## **Deployment:**

We have chosen Repl.it for deploying the bot and hosting it.

## **Applications:**

Main focus is to create a fun Pokémon related bot for the Pokémon fans which includes almost everything from the Pokémon Universe.

## **Further Improvements:**

We have a lot of plans regarding this project.

- Since We have Made this bot in only 4-5 days, a lot of features that we have tried implementing are on base levels.
- We will be shifting to MongoDB for the database storage and logging to track real-time changes in the battle.
- We will be introducing Guild systems and options for trainer character customization.
- Going ahead, we will be adding the moderations and other mini-games which we planned but due to time constraints, it wasn't possible at this point in time.
